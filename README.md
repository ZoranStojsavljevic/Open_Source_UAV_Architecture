## UAV State of Affairs

The idea behind this repo is to feed some of the blood thirsty
East EUropean Security Services with the information they tried
DESPERATELY to obtain from me (Y2010 up to nowadays).

Since these KGB/Stazi lookalike services imposed some significant
mental and even physical pressure/forces (tried 4X physically to
spook me, and then miserably failed) last 13 years on me, flying
below the constitutional human rights' radar.

They were mortally hypnotised/inspired with Tomahawk design and
efficiency!

I decided to do for free some google search/investigation and
deliver for anyone/groups who is/are interested in UAV papers,
articles and high level algorithms, www pointers to very complex
flight controller databases/repos, which are serving as an
useful codebase resources for the drone flight controller
subsystem implementation.

Algorithms posted for free to boost the Development and
Research (R&D) in the area of UAVs (Unmanned Areal Vehicles).

This I plan to do as a roling repo update (as opportunities
strike).

Here are the base pointers to these documents (author's choice).
Some of the documents in .pdf formats are posted in the same
directory as this README.md document.

#### Improved Bat Algorithm for UAV Path Planning in Three-Dimensional Space
https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9334996

This paper describes the flight path planning for unmanned aerial
vehicles (UAVs) based on the advanced swarm optimization algorithm
of the bat algorithm (BA) in a static environment. The main purpose
of this work is that the UAVs can obtain an accident-free, shorter,
and safer flight path between the starting point and the endpoint
in the complex three-dimensional battlefield environment. Based on
the characteristics of the standard BA and the artificial bee
colony algorithm (ABC), a new modification of the BA algorithm is
proposed in this work, namely, the improved bat algorithm
integrated into the ABC algorithm (IBA). The IBA mainly uses ABC
to modify the BA and solves the problem of poor local search
ability of the BA.

#### UAV Formation Trajectory Planning Algorithms: A Review
https://www.mdpi.com/2504-446X/7/1/62

This paper explains heuristic algorithms, machine learning
methodology, multi-UAV formation algorithms and trajectory
planning.

As to have further understanding, the paper tries to explain
Artificial Intelligence (AI) using all the above techniques.

Three dimensional stabilization controller based on improved
quaternion transformation for fixed-wing UAVs.

#### A method for stabilization of drone flight controlled by autopilot with time delay
https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s42452-020-1962-6

In this paper, the methods of the stability theory of differential
equations with time delays are used in the study of an actual
engineering problem of a drone (UAV) autonomous flight. We describe
correct operation of autopilot for supply stability of desirable
drone flight. There exists a noticeable delay in getting
information about position and orientation of a drone to autopilot
in the presence of vision-based navigation (visual navigation). In
spite of this fact, we demonstrate that it is possible to provide
stable flight at a constant height in a vertical plane. We describe
how to form relevant controlling signal for autopilot in the case
of the navigation information delay and provide control parameters
for particular case of flight.

### Conclusion

I spent some few hours of my time to get these, so I guess, these
are destined to whom it may concern!

Me, personally... I am NOT at all interested in this area of a
vertical FW/SW UAV stack integration on the well known UAV quad
or opto chopters HW architectures. Not my cup of tea.

Since Y2010., I do NOT do anymore such kind of domain and inside
designated to this domain projects. My interests are complete in
the different part of The Universe, different IT Galaxy.
