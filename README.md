## UAV State of Affairs

The idea behind this repo is to feed some of the blood thirsty
East EUropean Security Services with the information they tried
DESPERATELY to obtain from me (Y2013 up to nowadays).

Since these KGB/Stazi lookalike services imposed some significant
mental and even physical pressure/forces (tried 4X to spook me,
and then miserably failed) last ten years on me, flying below
the constitutional human rights' radar.

They were mortally hypnotised/inspired with Tomahawk design and
efficiency!

I decided to do for free some google search/investigation and
deliver for anyone/groups who is/are interested in UAV papers,
articles and high level algorithms, www pointers to very complex
flight controller databases/repos, which are serving as an
useful codebase resources for the drone flight controller
subsystem implementation.

Algorithms posted for free to boost the Development and
Research (R&D) in the area of UAVs (Unmanned Areal Vehicles).

This I plan to do as a roling repo update (as opportunities
strike).

Here are the base pointers to these documents (author's choice).
Some of the documents in .pdf formats are posted in the same
directory as this README.md document.

### UAV development repos/sites

#### Open Source Autopilot for Drone Developers
https://px4.io/

This is the Open Source repo for the autopilot development.

It is mainly driven by Swiss company called Autherion:

#### The open standards for drone hardware: pixhawk
https://pixhawk.org/

For Building Flight Controller Products Pixhawk Autopilot Reference
Standard:

#### MAVLink Developer Guide

MAVLink is a very lightweight messaging protocol for communicating
with drones (and between onboard drone components).

### Conclusion

I spent some few hours of my time to get these, so I guess, these
are destined to whom it may concern!

Me, personally... I am NOT at all interested in this area of a
vertical FW/SW UAV stack integration on the well known UAV quad
or opto chopters HW architectures. Not my cup of tea.

Since Y2010., I do NOT do anymore such kind of domain and inside
designated to this domain projects. My interests are complete in
the different part of The Universe, different IT Galaxy.
